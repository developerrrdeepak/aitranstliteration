The previous AI engineer was tasked with continuing the development of a multi-phase translation mobile app, specifically confirming the completion of Phase 1 and 2, then proceeding. Upon reviewing  and , Phase 1 (basic text translation) and the backend for Phase 2 (image translation/OCR) were confirmed operational. The engineer then focused on environment setup, encountering persistent  errors during [09:18:01] Starting project at /app/frontend attempts, indicating a shell or environment issue. After several debugging attempts, the user explicitly clarified to proceed with frontend camera/image upload for Phase 2, confirming backend OCR was working. The engineer then successfully added  and  dependencies and was about to create a camera screen component, despite the ongoing environment instability for Expo.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive mobile translation application across six distinct phases. Phase 1 focuses on core foundation, app structure, navigation, basic text translation interface, LLM integration for text translation, and basic database models. Phase 2 extends this to image translation, integrating camera functionality, image upload, OCR, and image-to-text translation. Subsequent phases include voice/conversation features, real-time camera translation, advanced AI/document features, and social/collaboration tools. The current state, as identified, is that Phase 1 is complete, and Phase 2's backend components (OCR and image translation APIs) are functional. The immediate task is to integrate these image translation capabilities into the mobile frontend, specifically camera and image upload features.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Expo:** Mobile application development framework for React Native.
- **FastAPI:** Python web framework for the backend APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data storage.
- **LLM Integration:** Used for text translation (backend).
- **OCR (EasyOCR):** Used for image-to-text translation (backend).
- **expo-router:** File-based routing for the Expo frontend.
- **expo-camera, expo-image-picker:** Expo libraries for camera access and image selection.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

Detailed Directory structure:


- **/app/backend/server.py**:
  - This file defines the FastAPI backend services. It includes endpoints for text translation () using a  and image translation with OCR () using . It also defines MongoDB models (, ) for persisting translation data.
- **/app/frontend/app/index.tsx**:
  - This is the initial entry point for the Expo Router frontend application. It currently serves as the minimal setup and initial screen. All navigable screens are expected to reside in the  directory within the frontend.
- **/app/frontend/package.json**:
  - This file manages the frontend's dependencies. It was recently updated to include  and  to support camera and image upload functionalities.
- **/app/test_result.md**:
  - This document provides a summary of the previous agent's work, confirming that Phase 1 (core foundation & basic text translation) and the backend components for Phase 2 (OCR and image translation APIs) are operational. It also outlines the problem statement and testing protocols.

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve persistent  errors preventing stable Expo frontend startup.
- Implement a camera screen component in the frontend using  and .
- Integrate image upload functionality to send images to the backend's  endpoint.
- Display image-to-text translation results in the frontend.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has confirmed the completion of Phase 1 (core foundation & basic text translation) and the backend implementation for Phase 2 (Image Translation & OCR), specifically that the  and  endpoints are operational. The current focus is on integrating the image translation features into the mobile frontend.

The engineer faced significant challenges getting the Expo frontend to run consistently due to recurring  errors, which complicated debugging and prevented a clear visual confirmation of the current UI state. Despite these environment issues, the engineer proceeded to prepare for frontend development by adding necessary dependencies.

The last successful action was the installation of  and  to , which are crucial for enabling camera access and image selection on the mobile device. The engineer is now poised to create a new camera screen component.
